Computer Programming 12 

Review Project – My Text-Based Game 

 

Instructions: After viewing the videos for this section, you should have a basic idea of what’s expected of you. In summary, you are going to be created a short, playable experience that integrates all of the topics we’ve covered in our review to showcase your ability to use these coding techniques in the context of a full program. In addition, I will be using this project to assess your current ability to create a cohesive program that runs, provides a good experience for the user, and presents code in an organized and clear manner. 

 

Here is a checklist of the topics you need to integrate into your work that you can use to ensure you design your short game with all of the needed content: 

 

Topic 

Checklist 

Comments 

 

Imports (using external libraries) 

 

Creating, accessing, and changing variables 

 

Casting variables to different types of data 

 

Conditional Logic (if statements) 

 

Loops (both for and while) 

 

Operators (+, -, *, /, %) 

 

Comparitors (>, <, ==, not, and, or) 

 

Arrays/Lists 

 

Classes/Objects 

 

Methods (of various forms) 

 

New Topics 

 

Inheritance 

 

Exception Handling 

 

 

The type of program/experience you create is up to you! You are required to have me sign off on any custom ideas you have before you develop them too deeply, however. Here is short list of ideas you can borrow! 

A “Battle Arena RPG” which pits your character against a variety of enemies in simple, turn-based battles. You could use Pokemon as the model for this, or come up with your own version. 

A “Choose Your Own Adventure” experience that allows the player to make lots of choices on storyline-driven paths that lead them to endpoints of victory or ruin! 

A series of small minigames the player can choose between, or be required to complete in succession to beat the full gauntlet experience. 

 

Assessment 

For this project, you will be assessed on 3 rubrics: your ability to integrate our review topics, the experience the created program provides, and quality of written code. Each are described in more detail below! 

 

Score 

Integration of Review Topics 

Assessing how many review topics you were able to integrate into this project. 

0 - 1 

You do not integrate enough review topics to receive credit for this category. 

2 – 3 

Five or six review topics are not fully integrated. 

4 - 5 

Three or four review topics are not fully integrated. 

6 - 7 

One or two review topic(s) is/are not fully integrated. 

8 

All review topics are fully integrated. 

 

 

Score 

Created Program Experience 

The playability, clarity, and user-friendliness of your experience overall. 

0 - 1 

Your program is not at all ready to be experienced. 

2 – 3 

Your program is clunky, unclear, and unintuitive too often. 

4 - 5 

Your program has components that are clunky, unclear, and unintuitive, but overall is playable. 

6 - 7 

The player has a good experience. Most content is smooth, clear, and intuitive. 

8 

The experience is consistently smooth, clear, and intuitive; lots of attention to the experience is evident. 

 

 

Score 

Quality of Code 

Assessing the organization, naming, spacing, and commenting of your code. 

0 - 1 

Code is immensely sloppy, unreadable, and disorganized below minimum standards. 

2 – 3 

Code is sloppy, insufficient, and disorganized in all categories, but above a passing level. 

4 - 5 

Code struggles with issues on 1 or 2 categories, but is competent in others. 

6 

Overall, code is highly competent in quality but struggles with consistency or a 7/8 score with no comments! 

7 

Overall, code is written with a consistent and high quality; minor mishaps or oversights. 

8 

All added code is high-quality in all required categories.
